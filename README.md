# SPI-IPM
Materials for setting up, running, analysing, and interpreting Integrated Population Models using SPI-Birds data.
Contains code for the different steps/analyses and a code manual providing background information and documenting the code.

Both analysis code and code manual are currently under development. 
If you would like to use (part of) the code before it is finalized and the documentation completed, or have other questions/inquiries about any of the materials, please contact Chloé R. Nater (chloe.nater@nina.no).
