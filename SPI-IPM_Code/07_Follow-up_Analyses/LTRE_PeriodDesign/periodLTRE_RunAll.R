## Determine how to treat immigration rates estimated at 0
# NOTE: Occasionally, there may be posterior samples that estimate immigration
#       rates at exactly 0 for entire time-periods. This is problematic for the
#       period-design LTRE, as calculations involve the log mean and log sd
#       difference of vital rates, and log(0) = Inf. 
#       Resulting contributions of immigration rates will default to NA, but 
#       contributions of other components for this posterior sample will still
#       have numerical values. This can potentially bias the posteriors of
#       relative contributions.
#       In the following, we present 2 options for avoiding such bias:

# Option 1:
FixLog0MeanRates <- FALSE
# Removes any samples which contain period-mean estimates of immigration rates
# equaling 0 completely prior to analysis.

# Option 2: 
FixLog0MeanRates <- TRUE
# Replaces all immigration rate means of 0 with the smallest non-0 individual 
# value estimated across all samples and time-steps prior to analysis
# (following advice by Warton and Hui, Ecology, 92(1), 2011, pp. 3â€“10).
# The same is done for immigration rate standard deviations of 0, but here the
# smallest non-0 value estimated over the entire study period across all samples
# is used. 

# For the cases tested so far, which option was used hardly affected posterior
# distributions of LTRE contributions at all. This is due to the fact that
# the number of samples with period-mean immigration rates of 0 is very low
# compared to the total number of samples. If such samples are more common,
# there may be non-negligible differences with the two options above.
